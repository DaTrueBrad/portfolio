                <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! It's my absolute pleaseure to have you here. I have many facets that go into me as a person, But you can scroll through here and find what you are interested in hearing.</p>
                <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
                <p>As you'll read in my career section, I very much love exercise. I compete in powerlifting competitions in exercises known as the Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift. Exercise became a passion for me early on and I continue to devote myself to it.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I also enjoy the outdoors! Currently I get to hike about once every week or two. When I have time, I love backpacking! Being able to go out into nature and disconnect from everything else and connect with who you are, it pulls me in!</p>
        <h2>Career History</h2>
        <h3>VASA Fitness</h3>
        <p>A large part of my work history comes from a company based out of Utah called VASA Fitness. They are a High Value Low Price (HVLP) gym model who is currently ranked in the Top 15 in the nation for fitness centers. It was my pleasure to work for them as a Personal Trainer, Sales Manager, and Fitness Manager over the course of three amazing years. The company structure helped me develop organization, learning, leadership, and drive. I loved helping out the members of the club through the Core Values UPLIFT, which stood for Unity, Passion, Love, Integrity, Fun, and Trust. I left the company becuse it was time for me to start a new chapter in my life using the knowledge I had been given the opportunity to acquire.</p>
